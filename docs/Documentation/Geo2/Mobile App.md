# Mobile App

You can download the mobile app from [**App Store**](https://apps.apple.com/app/geo2/id1594180686) and [**Google Play**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.geo2.app). The mobile app is best suited for solo delivery drivers, couriers, gig drivers, and drivers working for companies where route planning is done by a transport manager/dispatcher in Hub. The mobile app supports route planning and optimization, as well as order management. Additionally, the mobile app includes Proof of Delivery (POD) and vehicle check features to capture delivery confirmations and vehicle status at route start and completion. While the mobile app allows you to create and optimize routes and manage orders, the Hub offers advanced features for larger-scale operations, such as bulk order import via Excel (CSV), managing multiple routes on a single map, analytics and reporting, and AI-powered route building.

> ### Data and Costs
>
> The synchronization of high-resolution images - photos and signatures - as well as tracking are data-intensive.  Monitor mobile device data usage and consider either capping data usage in line with the mobile network provider contract or make use of "unlimited" data plans.  We cannot accept responsibility for any costs or losses incurred in the course of using the mobile app.
