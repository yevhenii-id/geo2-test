# Mobile App

You can download the mobile app from [**App Store**](https://apps.apple.com/app/geo2/id1594180686) and [**Google Play**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.geo2.app).  As a Geo2 mobile application user, you are typically a driver working with routes and tracking the deliveries/collections of orders.

> [!CAUTION]
> ### Data and Costs
>
> The synchronization of high-resolution images - photos and signatures - as well as tracking are data-intensive.  Monitor mobile device data usage and consider either capping data usage in line with the mobile network provider contract or make use of "unlimited" data plans.  We cannot accept responsibility for any costs or losses incurred in the course of using the mobile app.
