# Web-Based Hub

# Introduction

The web user interface is intended for administrators, managers and transport planners. While the mobile app allows drivers to create and optimize routes and manage orders, Hub offers advanced features for larger-scale operations, such as bulk order import via Excel (CSV), managing multiple routes on a single map, analytics and reporting, and AI-powered route building.
