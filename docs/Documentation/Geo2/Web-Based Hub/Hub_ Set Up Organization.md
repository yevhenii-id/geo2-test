# Introduction

Once your account is created, you need to set up your Geo2 workspace.

# About You

We ask for information about your company to set up an organization for you.  You need to provide your organization’s name, select the industry you work in, the number of vehicles your company has, and your role in the company.

By pressing the `Continue` button, you will be redirected to Set up first depot page.

# Set Up First Depot

On this page, you can create your first depot. It can be optionally used as a route start and end points during route planning. You can add more depots later in Settings → Environment -> [Hub: Depots Settings](Hub_%20Environment%20Settings/Hub_%20Depots%20Settings.md).

You can start searching for the address by typing it in the Address line 1 field or giving access to your current geolocation.  Once the address is provided, you can drag and drop the pin on the map to adjust the address. By pressing the `Continue` button, your organization, environment, and its first depot will be created.

**Organization** is a group of users who share a subscription and collaborate on data in one or more environments. By default, for your newly created organization, **you get a Free subscription**, **no card is required**. A subscription would be automatically assigned to you.

**Environments** let you represent teams within a single company or provide separate spaces for testing and productive use.

Examples:

- A large company (organization) with smaller teams (environments) working on different projects.
- A holding company (organization) with smaller companies (environments) working in different spheres.
- A middle-size company (organization) with several depots (environments).
