The free trial is available as long as neither the user nor the organization have had a free trial before.

## Purchase Additional Users

It is possible to add new users to the current subscription level, for example, for seasonal workers if you are on Advanced or Enterprise subscription level.  If you are on Advanced level, you can add up to 10 users to your organization in total. If you are on Enterprise level, you are not limited in the number of users. You can press the  `Add users` button on Subscriptions page, select the number of users, and proceed with payment.

If you want to buy your subscription for a month, select the "Monthly" switcher at the top of the page.  If you want to buy new subscription for a year, make sure the "Yearly" switcher is selected at the top of the page.  When paying yearly, you can **save up to 20%.** At Geo2, subscription pricing is calculated per user added to an organization.

You cannot select the number of months - if you currently have a monthly subscription, the upgrade will follow the monthly plan; if yearly, it will follow the yearly plan. You cannot select the number of users - all users from your current subscription level are included. Additionally, the start date cannot be changed; it will automatically be set to the current date.

On Checkout page, you will see the amount of money for unused days from your current subscription being subtracted from the total amount you pay for the subscription upgrade.

Once the payment is done, you will get a combined invoice/receipt on your email address.  Also, you can check your payment details in [Hub: Subscriptions](Hub_%20Subscriptions.md)**.**
