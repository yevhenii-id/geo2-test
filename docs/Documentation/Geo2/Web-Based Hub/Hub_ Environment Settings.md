# Introduction

Environments let you represent teams within a single company or provide separate spaces for testing and productive use.  An organization can contain one or more environments.  See [Concepts](../Concepts.md) for the different uses to which you may want to put environments.

# Environment Settings

During the registration of a new account and [Hub: Set Up Organization](Hub_%20Set%20Up%20Organization.md), the address entered will be saved as the environment’s address as well.  If you create an organization manually, its first default environment is created automatically.  By default, the name of a new environment is Default environment.  You can change the name by hovering over the environment name on Settings page and pressing the `Edit (pencil)` icon.

If you are invited to the environment and you have [Hub: User Roles](Hub_%20User%20Roles.md), you can reach environment settings by opening the menu and pressing the Environment selector.  You can also create a new environment if you have Enterprise subscription level.

You will be redirected to Create environment page where you will have the option to clone settings and users from an existing environment.

It is up to you whether you decide to clone settings or users or start an entirely fresh environment definition.
