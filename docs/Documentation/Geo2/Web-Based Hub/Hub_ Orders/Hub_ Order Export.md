# Introduction

It is possible to export orders data via the `Export CSV` button on Orders page.  This option is available only for orders created in the last 7 and 30 days.  You can press the `Export CSV` button and the full list of orders will be exported.  Alternatively, you can select the needed orders using the checkboxes on the left side of the card and then press the `Export CSV` button.
