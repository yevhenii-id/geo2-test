# Introduction

It is possible to import multiple orders at once via the `Import` button on Orders page.  This opens a spreadsheet interface for your data entry.

# Spreadsheet Interface

You can import order data into Geo2 Hub using two methods:

- Upload your spreadsheet file with column mapping
- Manually paste or type your data into the table.

## Upload Spreadsheet File with Column Mapping

Learn how to quickly import your spreadsheet file with column mapping <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJL8BpnLE8A>

Press the `Upload data from file` button at the top of the Import spreadsheet in Hub. Upload a .csv, .tsv, .xls, .xlxs, .xml, or .txt file. After uploading, the Map your data columns dialog will be displayed where you can match your spreadsheet columns to Hub’s data fields. Required fields are marked with an asterisk ( \* ) but you can skip them at this step and add data later.

On the dialog, you will see 4 columns:

|  **Column Heading**    |  **Description**                                                                                                      |
|:-----------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Your file column       | Displays the column headers from your uploaded file that the system will attempt to match with known fields.          |
| Your sample data       | Shows a preview of the data in each column from your uploaded file to help with identifying what each field contains. |
| Destination column     | Lets the user select or confirm which system field the uploaded column should map to.                                 |
| Matching result        | Indicates how well the system matched each column, including match strength and confidence percentage.                |

The system will attempt to auto-match fields like Route, Depot, Time at stop, etc. Matches are clearly marked with a green tick for perfect or high matches, while unmatched columns are shown with a yellow warning icon. You can adjust matches or choose to skip fields, including required ones, these can be added later.

Tooltips are available to help clarify each data point.

Once everything is mapped correctly, click `Apply`. Your data will appear in the table, where you can review, edit, or fix any errors before finalizing.

## Manually Type or Paste Data

The spreadsheet interface column headings guide you on the type of data expected in each column. Hover over a column title to see a tooltip with additional details and explanations.

If you have prepared the data in another spreadsheet, you can copy and paste them in.  It is also possible to import a file from your device without column mapping by pressing the `folder` icon.

The limit for the import of orders is **500**.  You cannot paste more into the spreadsheet. The last eight columns for the recipient address are important for successful geo-coding.  Required fields are highlighted with an asterisk ( \* ) near their names.

The following defaults will be applied to any unspecified values: Planned date - current date, Depot - default depot if it exists in Environment settings, Area - empty string, Trip - 1.  So, if only depot 01 is set and today's date is 1st August 2022, the route key would be generated as <code>20220801_01_1</code> (area left out).  The route will be created first.  The order will then be assigned to the route.  If a depot key is provided for orders, they are grouped by <code>Planned date</code> and <code>Depot</code> for creating a route.  An order depot is populated to a route start and end points.  If a depot key is not provided for orders, the default depot from Environment settings is used instead.  If there is no default depot, orders are grouped only by <code>Planned date</code>, and for a newly created routes, “First stop location” is selected as a route start and “Last stop location” as a route end. </p></li><li local-id="32cc026b-4b52-4b12-a1f8-66aac382ab72"><p local-id="c0af6238-faa5-4ca0-99aa-0fb71f0a81ab"><strong>If selected and route key (not yet existing) is provided</strong>, it will be used for newly created routes.

The order will then be assigned to the route.  If a depot key is provided for orders, they are grouped by <code>Planned date</code> and <code>Depot</code> for creating a route.  The first order depot in the list is populated to a route start and end points.  Once a route is created, we check if the next order depot matches the route depot.  If not, a separate route for this order is created using the same provided route key and different trip numbers.  If a depot key is not provided for orders, the default depot from Environment settings is used instead.

If the route depot is different to the order depot, the order is still created/updated, but there will be a warning that the order could not be assigned to the route due to a depot mismatch.  Orders without assigned depots can be added to any route, and if a route does not use a depot as its start or end point, any order, with or without a depot, can be added.  </p></li><li local-id="a1dbb2d1-83a9-4f68-a95d-f0afa45ce954"><p local-id="83c93354-20cd-41b3-9346-e81dea91f583">If the route key is not valid, the import of that order will error.</p></li></ul></li></ul> |
