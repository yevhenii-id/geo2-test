# Introduction

Organizations are groups of Geo2 users who share a subscription and collaborate on data in one or more [Hub: Environment Settings](Hub_%20Environment%20Settings.md).

# Organization Settings

During the registration of a new account and [Hub: Set Up Organization](Hub_%20Set%20Up%20Organization.md), the address entered will be saved as the organization’s address as well.  If you are invited to the organization and you have [Hub: User Roles](Hub_%20User%20Roles.md)**,** you can reach organization settings by pressing the Settings option in the menu.

## Organization Name

You can change your organization name by hovering over the organization name on Settings page and pressing the `Edit (pencil)` icon. Provide a new organization name and press the `Tick` icon to save changes.

## Billing address

If creating a new organization, you need to provide the Organization name and its billing address (Address line 1, City and Country fields); all other fields are optional.  The tax registration number will be shown on the combined invoice/receipt after successful payments.

To enter the address, you can start typing it into Address line 1 and selecting it from the drop-down which appears.  If no suitable match is found, continue entering the address in the relevant address fields manually.

### 7-day FREE Trial

You can take a 7-day FREE trial of any paid subscription level (Pro, Advanced, or Enterprise).

On Subscriptions page, you can check the list of available features for different subscription levels for the web-based Hub and mobile app. By enabling `Show differences only` toggle, you will see only differences between subscription levels ignoring what is included equally into each of them. For example:

![Screenshot 2025-08-26 at 13.41.25.png](../../attachments/64604098-aeac-4d3c-949c-d87e670f2dd0.png)![Screenshot 2025-08-26 at 13.41.37.png](../../attachments/fe01da0c-c57f-48f6-82a3-7d234c31cefa.png)

If you take a free trial of Pro subscription, you can get 1-user subscription that is automatically assigned to you. If you take a free trial of Advanced or Enterprise subscription level, you сan get up to 5-user subscription, so you can invite up to 4 additional users to your organization. See how to [Page not accessible (ID: 23101506)]. If you want to add more users, you can do it after taking a free trial by pressing the `Add users` button. Learn how to [Page not accessible (ID: 23101506)].

**You do not pay anything when taking a trial, it is FREE for 7 days.** By pressing `Assign subscription to users` on Success page, you will be redirected to Organization settings → Users to invite more people.

On Subscriptions page, your current level will be highlighted with a green background and labeled as “Current level.” Here, you can view the number of assigned subscriptions out of your total, the valid dates (from and to), and the date of your next payment.

![Screenshot 2025-08-26 at 13.54.16.png](../../attachments/ea253daa-9351-43db-be6d-beca07d5f01b.png)

The free trial is available as long as neither the user nor the organization have had a free trial before.

### Purchase Additional Users

It is possible to add new users to the current subscription level, for example, for seasonal workers if you are on Advanced or Enterprise subscription level.  If you are on Advanced level, you can add up to 10 users to your organization in total. If you are on Enterprise level, you are not limited in the number of users. You can press the  `Add users` button, select the number of users, and proceed with payment.

If you want to buy your subscription for a month, select the "Monthly" switcher at the top of the page.  If you want to buy new subscription for a year, make sure the "Yearly" switcher is selected at the top of the page.  When paying yearly, you can **save up to 20%.**

![Screenshot 2025-08-26 at 14.10.52.png](../../attachments/a05d1c41-2ba3-439b-a9de-9b8e73e2f381.png)

Once the payment is done, you will get a combined invoice/receipt on your email address.  Also, you can check your payment details in [Page not accessible (ID: 23101506)].

Press `Assign subscription to users` on Success payment page to be redirected to Organization settings → Users.  You can invite more users to assign subscriptions.  See how to [Page not accessible (ID: 23101506)].

New subscriptions will be displayed above the existing one on your current subscription level, with the number of available users and valid-from/to dates.

### Upgrade a Subscription

If you currently have the Pro, or Advanced subscription, you can optionally upgrade to the Advanced, or Enterprise level accordingly.  Press the `Upgrade` button for the higher level.

![Screenshot 2025-08-26 at 14.12.43.png](../../attachments/16db32c6-fba2-4d6f-b1cc-76aa8b87f81a.png)

You cannot select the number of months - if you currently have a monthly subscription, the upgrade will follow the monthly plan; if yearly, it will follow the yearly plan. You cannot select the number of users - all users from your current subscription level are included. Additionally, the start date cannot be changed; it will automatically be set to the current date.

On Checkout page, you will see the amount of money for unused days from your current subscription being subtracted from the total amount you pay for the subscription upgrade.

Once the payment is done, you will get a combined invoice/receipt on your email address.  Also, you can check your payment details in [Page not accessible (ID: 23101506)]**.**

Press `Assign subscriptions to users` to be redirected to Organization settings → Users.  You can invite more users to assign subscriptions.  See how to [Page not accessible (ID: 23101506)]. If all subscriptions are already assigned, you will see the message about it on this page.

After successful payment, your current subscription level will be automatically updated.

## Cancel Subscription

To cancel your subscription(s), press `Cancel subscription` button on your current level below the number of users and valid dates. The prompt will be displayed to confirm your action.

![Screenshot 2025-08-26 at 14.14.17.png](../../attachments/437320b8-17d3-4a5d-bb3e-ff2924f3471a.png)

Once the subscription is cancelled, only the valid from/to dates will be shown, and the next payment information will no longer be displayed.

## Expired Subscription

When your subscription expires, you'll see a prompt offering two options:

- Extend your current subscription
- Continue with a Free level subscription.

By pressing `Extend subscription`, you will be redirected to Subscriptions page where you can renew your subscription, change number of users (for Advanced or Enterprise levels) or your subscription level.

By pressing `Continue with Free subscription`, a Free level subscription will be assigned to you automatically, allowing you to keep using Geo2 with limited features. A Free level subscription is limited to **one user per organization**; all other users in your organization will lose access.

| Organization role | Role is a set of permissions for the user in the organization.  Each user can either have the role of User, which does not enable them to modify the organization, or Admin, which gives them control over the organization, including the ability to create environments.  For organization user roles and their permissions, see [**User Roles**](https://balloonone.atlassian.net/wiki/x/L4D_Ag#Organization-Roles). |

**To enable the use of the Geo2 product, an Organization Admin needs to assign a subscription to a newly invited user.**The message at the top of the `Users` tab informs you about your current organization subscription.

You also need to choose the environment(s) to which a user will have access and their role in each of them.  For environment user roles and their permissions, see [Hub: User Roles](Hub_%20User%20Roles.md).

![Screenshot 2025-08-26 at 14.21.07.png](../../attachments/bd2f81c2-23a5-4eaa-a7e3-058105c8f61b.png)

The `Status` value against the user shows you if the invitation has been accepted.  You can select one or more users using the checkbox leading each row.  Pressing `Delete` will remove the selected users from the organization.  When `Deleted are hidden` is enabled, both active and deleted users are shown.  Previously deleted users can be recovered, i.e. made active again.

![Screenshot 2025-08-26 at 14.21.57.png](../../attachments/e790a0b0-ed4a-4b52-a452-952d32fcdf16.png)

Deleting a user frees up that user's subscription.  After a user is recovered, a subscription needs to be assigned to them to become functional.

Product news emails are enabled by default.  To turn off the emails, the Organization Admin can unset the `Product news email` toggle and press `Update` to save changes.  A user will receive product news emails if they are enabled in at least one of the organizations they belong to.  It is also possible to turn off the emails in profile settings.

### Import Users

You can import user data into Geo2 Hub using two methods:

- Upload your spreadsheet file with column mapping
- Manually paste or type your data into the table.

![Screenshot 2025-08-26 at 14.22.28.png](../../attachments/d79d817d-d094-4e9d-a157-31f02666d738.png)

#### Upload Spreadsheet File with Column Mapping

Press the `Upload data from file` button at the top of the Import spreadsheet in Hub. Upload a .csv, .tsv, .xls, .xlxs, .xml, or .txt file. After uploading, the Map your data columns dialog will be displayed where you can match your spreadsheet columns to Hub’s data fields. Required fields are marked with an asterisk ( \* ) but you can skip them at this step and add data later.

On the dialog, you will see 4 columns:

|  **Column Heading**    |  **Description**                                                                                                      |
|:-----------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Your file column       | Displays the column headers from your uploaded file that the system will attempt to match with known fields.          |
| Your sample data       | Shows a preview of the data in each column from your uploaded file to help with identifying what each field contains. |
| Destination column     | Lets the user select or confirm which system field the uploaded column should map to.                                 |
| Matching result        | Indicates how well the system matched each column, including match strength and confidence percentage.                |

![Screenshot 2025-08-26 at 14.24.32.png](../../attachments/5903a035-ea16-4b3d-b2d1-2a0e5e930a24.png)

The system will attempt to auto-match fields like Email address, First name, Last name, etc. Matches are clearly marked with a green tick for perfect or high matches, while unmatched columns are shown with a yellow warning icon. You can adjust matches or choose to skip fields, including required ones, these can be added later.

![Screenshot 2025-08-26 at 14.24.47.png](../../attachments/ecab6a78-5411-4000-86b8-9687c5366343.png)

Tooltips are available to help clarify each data point.

![Screenshot 2025-08-26 at 14.26.12.png](../../attachments/7c463b0d-9dc3-4c5f-ac89-52587d5c2528.png)

Once everything is mapped correctly, click `Apply`. Your data will appear in the table, where you can review, edit, or fix any errors before finalizing.

![Screenshot 2025-08-26 at 14.25.02.png](../../attachments/668b50bc-c76a-486c-8282-9e52ea8213d1.png)

#### Manually Type or Paste Data

The spreadsheet interface column headings guide you on the type of data expected in each column.  Hover over a column title to see a tooltip with additional details and explanations.

![Screenshot 2025-08-26 at 14.26.55.png](../../attachments/84c98d62-fae5-4c0b-b3be-8b117ff5525d.png)

If you have prepared the data in another spreadsheet, you can copy and paste them in.  It's also possible to import a file from your device without column mapping by pressing the `folder` icon.

![Screenshot 2025-08-26 at 14.27.26.png](../../attachments/d6e36a93-9f89-4f5c-b69c-a1d9b142b41f.png)

The limit for the import of users is **50**.  You cannot paste more than that into the spreadsheet.

To enable the use of the Geo2 product, an Organization Admin needs to assign a subscription to a newly invited user.

You also need to choose the environment(s) to which the user will have access and their role in each of them.  For environment user roles and their permissions, see [Hub: User Roles](Hub_%20User%20Roles.md).  When importing multiple users, the same settings are applied to all of them.

Click the `Import` button to import users.  The import process feeds back any errors that it encounters.

Users will be imported and displayed in the Users list in Organization and Environment settings.  Emails with invitations will be sent to all imported users.  Learn how users can [Hub: Accept Invitation](Hub_%20Accept%20Invitation.md).

#### Spreadsheet Example

You can download an example spreadsheet with typed-in information for user import.
