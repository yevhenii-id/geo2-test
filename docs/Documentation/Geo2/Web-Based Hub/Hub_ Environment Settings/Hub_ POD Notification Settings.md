# Hub: POD Notification Settings

A recipient can be sent an email with an order POD (proof of delivery) - both automatically when the POD is recorded and manually at any time from Geo2 Hub. The sender address of email notifications is [noreply@geo2.com](mailto:noreply@geo2.com) if there is no indicated Sender name.  Here are the configurable settings in Settings → Environment → POD notification:

|  **Setting**      |  **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| Automatic enabled | If selected, POD messages will be sent automatically to a recipient email address and fixed emails (for failed POD emails) when a POD is registered in Hub.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Attach PDF        | Attach a PDF document with POD details to the message.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Fixed recipient   | For failure notifications only, a fixed email recipient for the notifications.  Failed delivery emails can be sent to multiple fixed recipients, for example, to managers who are responsible for failed deliveries.  Multiple email addresses can be entered, separated by a semi-colon (;) or by pressing `Enter`.  To edit the entered email address, press it. <br/> For Partially successful POD emails, a Failed template will be used. If fixed recipients are provided, Partially successful POD emails will be sent to them as well (even though they are turned off on an order level). |
| Subject           | Subject line of notifications.  You can use these tokens for POD emails: <br/> **{CONTACT\_NAME}** - recipient name <br/> **{ORDER\_KEY}** - order key <br/> **{COMPANY\_NAME}** - сompany name <br/> **{ENVIRONMENT\_NAME}**- environment name                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Body              | Body of notifications.  You can use these tokens for POD emails: <br/> **{CONTACT\_NAME}** - recipient name <br/> **{ORDER\_KEY}** - order key <br/> **{PUBLIC\_POD}** - POD tracking link <br/> **{COMPANY\_NAME}** - сompany name <br/> **{ENVIRONMENT\_NAME}**- environment name                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
