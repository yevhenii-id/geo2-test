# Hub: Areas Settings

Areas let you tag depots and routes by user-defined geographical regions.  To add an area, press the `Add` button in Settings → Environment → Areas.

You will see the form to fill in the information.  Key and Name are required fields, others are optional.

You can select an area to `Delete` it.  For data integrity, it is best to not delete an area once it has started to be used.
