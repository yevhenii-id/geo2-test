# Organization Selector

When registering a new account and [Hub: Set Up Organization](Hub_%20Set%20Up%20Organization.md), your default organization is created using the name you provided during workspace setup. Its name appears in the menu.

To create a new organization, click the `Create organization` button in the menu. You will be redirected to the Create organization page. Provide the Organization name and billing address (Address line 1, City, and Country); other fields are optional. The tax registration number appears on the combined invoice/receipt after payment.

To enter the address, start typing it into Address line 1 and select from the drop-down. If no match appears, complete the address fields manually.

You will be redirected to Create environment page where you will have the option to clone settings and users from an existing environment.
