Suggestions appear as you type. The selected start point is displayed on the map with a green pin and can be moved to adjust the address on the Create or Edit Route pages in Hub. <br/> For the **route end**, you can choose to return to the start, set the last stop location (last order’s consignee address), or enter an address. The selected end point is displayed on the map with a red pin and can also be adjusted. <br/> On the Route plan page in Hub, route start and end points now appear as separate cards, displaying either a depot key, the first or last stop location, or an address. <br/> Learn more about [Page not accessible (ID: 23101839)]. |

Display separate start and end points on Route view page | Similar to Hub, in addition to selecting a depot as the route’s start and end point, you can now customize them separately. For the **route start**, you can use your current geolocation, choose the first stop location (first order’s consignee address), or **enter an address** using the search option. You will be redirected to Route start page where you can type your address. Suggestions appear as you type. The selected start point is displayed on the map then with a green pin. <br/> For the **route end**, you can choose to return to the start, set the last stop location (last order’s consignee address), or **enter an address**.

If a route starts or ends at a depot, orders with depots must match: the delivery depot must align with the start, and the collection depot with the end. Orders without assigned depots can be added to any route, and if a route does not use a depot as its start or end point, any order, with or without a depot, can be added.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

It is used to consider average speed **for route optimization and planned timing adjustments**. Each type has a default speed factor, but you can customize it by expanding Measures on the dialog and entering a value in the Speed factor field. The speed factor is the average speed as a multiple of an average car. For realistic route timings, this is typically set below 1 for heavier vehicles, such as vans and lorries. <br/> **Existing vehicles in your environments will default to "Van"** vehicle type but their speed factors will remain unchanged as you set up. To update multiple vehicles at once, use the import feature. <br/> Learn more about [Page not accessible (ID: 23101850)].                                                                                                                                     |
| IBALDEV-6494                                       | Hub: Display POD statuses on stop cards related to current load and ad-hoc POD's                                                                                                                        | When a POD is created for an order in the mobile app, its status is displayed on the stop card on **Route plan** page in Hub. Clicking on the POD icon allows you to view its details. POD's associated with the current route as well as POD’s without an assigned route (**ad-hoc POD**) will be shown on Route plan page. This means that if a POD was created for this stop as part of another route, it will not appear in the current route view. However, all POD's for a specific order you can still find on **Orders** page.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Once both arrival and departure times are recorded, the actual stop duration is calculated based on the time difference. This duration appears on the stop card on Route plan page in Hub, allowing you to compare the planned and actual stop duration and take action when necessary. <br/> Learn more about [Page not accessible (ID: 23101801)].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
