| IBALDEV-6144 | Hub: Use "Failed" template for POD emails sent for Partially successful POD status                          | Previously, the "Successful" email template was used when sending an email for a POD with a "Partially successful" status. This has now been updated to use the "Failed" email template instead. If you create a POD with a "Partially successful" status and have enabled sending POD emails in your Environment settings, the "Failed" email template will be applied. To make changes to your email templates, navigate to [Page not accessible (ID: 23101850)]. |

The full list of drivers and vehicles is still displayed, but any mismatched driver or vehicle will be greyed out while remaining visible in the list. <br/> Learn more about [Page not accessible (ID: 23101850)].                                     |
