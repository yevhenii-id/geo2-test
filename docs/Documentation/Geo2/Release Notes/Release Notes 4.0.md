| Mobile app: New and faster way to plan and run routes                   | The new route and order creation flow helps you start faster and stay focused throughout your day. When you open the app, the most relevant route is shown automatically, or you’re guided to plan a new one if no routes are available. You can quickly create a route using smart defaults, **select your start and end locations**, choose or create a vehicle, and **add stops using address search, scanning, or voice input**. Stops can be customized with time windows, packages, notes, and delivery details, while automatic optimization finds the fastest route. You can manage breaks, load your vehicle, and start navigation with your preferred map app. As you progress, you can complete stops, create proofs of delivery, and move to the next route. All in one intuitive flow. |
| Mobile app: Automatic route optimization after adding of orders         | After you add orders and click `Done`, **the app automatically optimize your route** to find a faster or shorter option, showing a brief loading message (“Finding the fastest route”). You will see a comparison between your current route and an optimized one, and you can choose which to use. If no real improvement is possible, the app will let you know that you are already on the fastest route.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
