| Mobile app: Multi-language support            | With this update, the mobile app is now available in **French**, **Brazilian Portuguese**, **Spanish**, **Romanian**, and **Ukrainian** helping international teams work more comfortably in their preferred language.  Changing the language takes just a few taps. Open **Settings**, scroll to the bottom, select **Language**, and choose your preferred option — the app will update immediately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Mobile app: Configurable POD settings         | Proof of Delivery is now fully configurable, giving you more control over how delivery confirmations are recorded. You can enable or disable POD entirely and decide which fields — such as **Contact name**, **Remarks**, **Signature**, and **Photos** — are required for Successful or Partially successful/Failed deliveries. The POD screen automatically adjusts according to your settings, ensuring a better experience for drivers. The result is fewer mistakes and more accurate, reliable delivery documentation for both your team and your customers. <br/> Learn more about [Mobile App: POD - Proof of Delivery](../Mobile%20App/Mobile%20App_%20POD%20-%20Proof%20of%20Delivery.md).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Mobile app: Location points for driver breaks | You can now optionally add a specific location to your breaks directly in the mobile app. When creating or editing a break, you can search, scan, use voice input, manually enter an address, or select your current location, and it will be displayed on the break card along with the planned time and duration. Breaks with a location appear as a coffee marker on the map, support navigation, and are included in route autocalibration when added, updated, or deleted. You can also complete, edit, or delete breaks, with completed breaks shown in reduced opacity on the map. <br/> Learn more about [Mobile App: Routes and Stops](../Mobile%20App/Mobile%20App_%20Routes%20and%20Stops.md).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Mobile app: Profile in Menu                   | Profile information is now available in the Menu. Tap it to open the Profile page, where you can update your personal details or sign out of the app.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Hub: Geo AI assistant                         | A smart, always-available helper named **Geo** is now built directly into the web-based Hub. Simply click the AI icon in the bottom-right corner and start a conversation. The AI assistant can guide you through how Geo2 works by referencing the documentation and sharing direct links for deeper reading whenever needed — whether you’re asking *“How to import orders?”*, *“Do you have optimization with time windows?”*, *“How to add orders to routes?”*, or wondering *“Can I track drivers’ location in real time?”* and *“Is it possible to notify customers about drivers’ location?”* <br/> Whether it’s finding answers, navigating features, or understanding workflows, the AI assistant is always within reach — fully integrated across every page and also accessible from a dedicated menu option.                                                                                                                                                      |
| Hub: Configurable Proof of delivery settings  | The updated Proof of Delivery settings let you **turn POD functionality on or off** and define which information must be captured for different delivery results. In the revised “Proof of delivery” tab in Hub Settings, you can use simple toggles to **make fields such as Contact name, Remarks, Signature, and Photos required** for Successful or Partially successful/Failed deliveries. In addition, PDF attachments have been removed from POD emails, with a Download button instead available on the public POD page. These settings will be available in Hub shortly, while support in the mobile app will follow in release 4.2. <br/> Learn more about a [Mobile App: POD - Proof of Delivery](../Mobile%20App/Mobile%20App_%20POD%20-%20Proof%20of%20Delivery.md).                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Hub: Location points for driver breaks        | Drivers’ breaks can now optionally include a specific location in addition to stop duration. When adding a break from Route or Map view, users can search and select an address, adjust its exact position on a map, and expand the form to fill in additional address details if needed. Once added, the break card displays its title, editable stop duration, planned arrival time, and — if provided — the company name and full address, with an option to delete the break. Breaks with a location are shown on the map with a coffee marker, and route autocalibration automatically accounts for the break location when breaks are added, edited, or deleted. Address is optional, but if a user starts entering one, all required fields will be highlighted. <br/> This improvement will be available in Hub shortly, with mobile app support coming in release 4.2. <br/> Learn more about adding [Hub: Routes](../Web-Based%20Hub/Hub_%20Routes.md) through Hub. |
