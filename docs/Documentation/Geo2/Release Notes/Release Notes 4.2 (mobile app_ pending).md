| Hub: Geo AI assistant                        | A smart, always-available helper named **Geo** is now built directly into the web-based Hub. Simply click the AI icon in the bottom-right corner and start a conversation. The AI assistant can guide you through how Geo2 works by referencing the documentation and sharing direct links for deeper reading whenever needed — whether you’re asking *“How to import orders?”*, *“Do you have optimization with time windows?”*, *“How to add orders to routes?”*, or wondering *“Can I track drivers’ location in real time?”* and *“Is it possible to notify customers about drivers’ location?”* <br/> Whether it’s finding answers, navigating features, or understanding workflows, the AI assistant is always within reach — fully integrated across every page and also accessible from a dedicated menu option.                                                                                                                                                      |
| Hub: Configurable Proof of delivery settings | The updated Proof of Delivery settings let you **turn POD functionality on or off** and define which information must be captured for different delivery results. In the revised “Proof of delivery” tab in Hub Settings, you can use simple toggles to **make fields such as Contact name, Remarks, Signature, and Photos required** for Successful or Partially successful/Failed deliveries. In addition, PDF attachments have been removed from POD emails, with a Download button instead available on the public POD page. These settings will be available in Hub shortly, while support in the mobile app will follow in release 4.2. <br/> Learn more about a [Mobile App: POD - Proof of Delivery](../Mobile%20App/Mobile%20App_%20POD%20-%20Proof%20of%20Delivery.md).                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Hub: Location points for driver breaks       | Drivers’ breaks can now optionally include a specific location in addition to stop duration. When adding a break from Route or Map view, users can search and select an address, adjust its exact position on a map, and expand the form to fill in additional address details if needed. Once added, the break card displays its title, editable stop duration, planned arrival time, and — if provided — the company name and full address, with an option to delete the break. Breaks with a location are shown on the map with a coffee marker, and route autocalibration automatically accounts for the break location when breaks are added, edited, or deleted. Address is optional, but if a user starts entering one, all required fields will be highlighted. <br/> This improvement will be available in Hub shortly, with mobile app support coming in release 4.2. <br/> Learn more about adding [Hub: Routes](../Web-Based%20Hub/Hub_%20Routes.md) through Hub. |
