| Mobile app: Сhanges for a faster way of adding route stops           | You can now add route stops by typing addresses one by one — no extra tapping on the search bar, just keep typing addresses as you go. Stops can be added by typing an address, choosing one from search results, or using scan and voice search. When you are done, the **Finish adding stops** button is always visible at the bottom of the screen. Tap it, and your route is automatically optimized and ready to go. <br/> Learn more about [Mobile App: Routes and Stops](../Mobile%20App/Mobile%20App_%20Routes%20and%20Stops.md). |
| Mobile app: "Undelivered only" switcher for stops on Route view page | The Route view now includes a clear “Stops” title above the list along with an “Undelivered only” switcher. With the switcher off by default, all stops in the route remain visible, including both delivered and undelivered stops, with or without proof of delivery. Turning the switcher on filters the list to show only undelivered stops, helping you focus on what still needs to be done and keep routes running smoothly.                                                                                                       |
| Hub: Organization ID field in Billing address in Settings            | You can now find your organization ID at the top of Billing address page in Settings. Click the copy icon to copy it for support requests if needed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
