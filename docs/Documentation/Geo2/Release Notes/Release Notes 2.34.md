These routes are then automatically optimized, either considering or ignoring consignment time windows. <br/> With this update, route optimization also takes into account **vehicle dimensions** such as **height, width, length, and gross weight** based on the values set in [Page not accessible (ID: 23101850)]. The system generates the most efficient routes to avoid bridges with height restrictions, narrow roads unsuitable for wider vehicles, or areas with weight limits that could affect the selected route. <br/> Learn more about [Hub: AI Route Building](../Web-Based%20Hub/Hub_%20Orders/Hub_%20AI%20Route%20Building.md).                                                                       |

As always, the planned stop duration will be displayed on a stop card on Route plan and Map view pages. If you edit the value, the updated duration will also appear inside the order. By default, if no specific value is provided, the system will use the stop duration set in [Page not accessible (ID: 23101850)].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Clicking on the POD icon allows you to view its details. Now, only POD's associated with the current route will be shown on **Route plan** page. This means that if a POD was created for this stop as part of another route or before being assigned to any route, it will not appear in the current route view. However, all POD's for a specific order you can still find on **Orders** page.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Learn more about [Page not accessible (ID: 23101839)]. <br/> This functionality is now available in the mobile app. If you have permission to create and modify routes, you can add participants on Create/Edit route pages.

For [Page not accessible (ID: 23101839)], only the main driver’s geolocation will be displayed in Hub. However, for POD's, the geolocation of the user who records it will be captured (either the driver or participant).                                                       |

It becomes available when at least 1 order in the route has "Required from" and/or "Required to" times set. By pressing it, the system will generate the most efficient route, factoring in time windows to help reduce costs and save time. You can still use "Optimize without time windows" for standard optimization based only on distance and traffic. Also, if vehicle dimensions (Gross weight, Height, Width, and Length) are set in [Page not accessible (ID: 23101850)], the system will factor in vehicle restrictions to avoid height-limited bridges, narrow roads, or weight-restricted areas when optimizing routes either with or without time windows.

You can create a proof of delivery and then press Record arrival. The time difference between these actions is recorded as the actual stop duration. <br/> If you select multiple stops on Route plan page and press the Record departure and Record arrival buttons, the stop duration will be saved for each stop. In the upcoming 2.35 Hub release, this recorded stop duration will be displayed on stop cards on Route plan page, under the "Planned stop duration". <br/> If "Record actual stop duration" is disabled, these buttons will not be shown in the mobile app, and no changes will apply. |
