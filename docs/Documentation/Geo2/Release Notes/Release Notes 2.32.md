| IBALDEV-6011 <br/> IBALDEV-6012 | Mobile app: Add "Partially successful" status for product level failures <br/> Hub: Add "Partially successful" status for product level failures in POD history | With product-level failures on the Create POD page, it is possible to mark a product as undelivered by unclicking/de-selecting it from the list. A prompt will be displayed to choose a failure reason code and specify the failed quantity. See more details on [Page not accessible (ID: 23101811)]. <br/> Previously, marking a product as undelivered would automatically assign it a "Failed" status, regardless of the number of failed quantities. Now, you can specify the failed quantity, for example, 5 out of 10 planned, and the failure reason code, along with the failed quantity, will be highlighted in orange colour on the product card. The product will be assigned a "Partially successful" status. If the entire product quantity is marked as failed, the failure reason code will be highlighted in red colour on the product card, and the product will receive a "Failed" status. These updates also apply to the POD details page. <br/> For products linked to packages, this functionality was already introduced in the 2.31 release.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| IBALDEV-6020                    | Mobile app: Changes in field "Number of packages/planned" on Create POD page                                                                                    | The "Number of packages / planned" field on the Create POD and POD details pages has been renamed to "Successful packages / planned". If a consignment has no pre-defined packages, this field is editable, allowing you to input values, e.g. 4/6 to indicate 4 successfully delivered out of 6 planned. Once packages are added or scanned, the field becomes read-only and updates to show the added or scanned count. If the planned package total is set for a consignment via the Hub or API, the field is also read-only, and adding or scanning packages is limited to the planned total number. For consignments with pre-defined packages, the field displays the total count, such as 2/2 or 3/3. In any case, if packages are unselected during POD creation to mark them as undelivered, the "Successful packages / planned" field adjusts accordingly, e.g. 3 successful out of 6 planned. Partially successful packages are counted as failed. See more details about the [Page not accessible (ID: 23101811)].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| IBALDEV-5084                    | Mobile app: Display depot info for ad-hoc vehicle check in history                                                                                              | When you create an ad-hoc vehicle check for a specific vehicle, the depot information is taken automatically from this vehicle. Each vehicle is linked to a depot in [Page not accessible (ID: 23101850)]. On the Vehicle check details page in the mobile app, the assigned depot will now be displayed, replacing the previous "No depot info" message.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

In the mobile app, if the email is not verified, you will see the following message: "Please check your email, follow the activation link, and reload the page." At this point, an email with a verification link will be sent to you. If you choose not to verify your email, you still have the option to sign out from your account.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| IBALDEV-6122                    | Hub: Load building time windows option                                                                                                                          | With the previous 2.31 release, we introduced load optimization considering consignment time windows, the "Required from" and "Required to" fields in a consignment. See more details about [Page not accessible (ID: 23101839)]. <br/> This functionality is now extended to the Load building feature. When you select consignments on the Consignments page and click the `Load building` button, a prompt will appear with a new checkbox **"Consider time windows."** If the selected consignments have required time windows, you can enable this option. Once loads are generated using the Load building functionality, the system will automatically optimize them by factoring in the time windows of the assigned consignments. <br/> After the optimization is complete, you still retain full control over the load. You can manually adjust the stop sequence by dragging and dropping stops as needed. Once you are satisfied with the adjustments, simply press `Save` to apply automatic recalibration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| IBALDEV-5983                    | Hub: Environment settings -> Vehicles - add gross weight and dimensions                                                                                         | The layout of the Add vehicle dialog in Environment settings → Vehicles has been improved. The most important and required fields, such as Key, Registration, Speed factor, Depot, Vehicle categories, Description, and Available for load building, are now displayed first. To access vehicle dimensions, click the Measures button, which expands the dialog to show additional settings such as Weight and Volume capacity, and Emissions factor. See more details about [Page not accessible (ID: 23101850)]. <br/> This update also introduces new fields: Gross Weight, Height, Width, and Length. These dimensions can now be provided to run load optimization and calibration by considering vehicle restrictions. The system will factor these dimensions into route building to generate the most efficient outcomes, for example, to avoid bridges with height restrictions, narrow roads unsuitable for wider vehicles, or areas with weight limits that could affect the selected route. Additionally, hovering over the question mark icon next to each field provides more details about its purpose and the expected data input. <br/> To quickly update your existing vehicles, use the `Import` button. In the Import spreadsheet, you can include vehicle dimensions as well. Once ready, press Import and select the "Existing vehicles will be updated" option. The system will match vehicles based on their key values and update their details accordingly. |
| IBALDEV-6112                    | Hub: Load calibration/optimization with vehicle restrictions                                                                                                    | In Environment settings → Vehicles, you can now enter values for the new vehicle properties: Gross weight, Height, Width, and Length. Based on the dimensions of the vehicle assigned to a load, running load calibration or optimization — whether or not consignment time windows are considered — will create the most efficient route. For example, the system can avoid bridges with height restrictions, narrow roads unsuitable for wider vehicles, or areas with weight limits that might impact the route. Vehicle restrictions are not yet automatically applied to optimization for loads generated through the Load building feature. This improvement is planned for one of the upcoming releases. <br/> See more details about [Page not accessible (ID: 23101839)] and [Page not accessible (ID: 23101839)].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

On the Map view page, you can also add unassigned consignments to the No load card. See more details about [Hub: Map View](../Web-Based%20Hub/Hub_%20Map%20View.md). <br/> Additionally, you can now select stops directly on the map — regardless of whether they are assigned to existing loads — and click the `Create` load button. After filling in the necessary load details on the dialog, such as Key, Trip, Status, and Planned start, click `Create` to generate a new load with the selected stops. The new load will then appear on the map. If any of the selected stops belong to existing loads, you will be prompted to confirm whether you want to move those stops to the newly created load.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
