| IBALDEV-3370 | Mobile app: Multiple consignment keys in one ad-hoc POD                                 | Provided the possibility of adding or scanning multiple consignment Keys while creating an ad-hoc POD. The consignments will then have the same information as the POD that has been created. An email notification will be sent to the contact specified in the POD. See [Page not accessible](../../../../../../../../Page%20not%20accessible/Page%20not%20accessible.md).                                                                                                                                                                                |
| IBALDEV-3623 | Mobile app: Notify user about no organization created                                   | Added the notification that a user has to set up Organization and Environment settings in the Web Hub for using the mobile app. See [Mobile app: Organization and Environment](../Mobile%20app_%20Organization%20and%20Environment.md).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| IBALDEV-3787 | Mobile app: Do not allow to add packages to POD if consignment has pre-defined packages | Removed the adding and scanning of packages on the POD creation page if a consignment has pre-defined packages from the Web Hub. There still will be information about packages for a consignment, and a driver has to agree whether all packages have been delivered (successful POD) or have not been delivered (failed POD). If there are no pre-defined packages in the consignment, a driver still has the possibility to add or scan packages. See [Page not accessible](../../../../../../../../Page%20not%20accessible/Page%20not%20accessible.md). |
| IBALDEV-3165 | Mobile app: Integrate CodePush                                                          | The technical task for running releases faster.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| IBALDEV-3452 | Web UI: Bulk move and role assign users between Environments                            | The Add button in the Environment settings can now be used to select multiple users from other Environments and move them to the current Environment a user is on. Once users are selected, it's possible to assign them a role to be transferred to the current Environment. This is only for users that currently exist within the Geo2 Organization. See [Page not accessible](../../../../../../../../Page%20not%20accessible/Page%20not%20accessible.md).                                                                                              |
| IBALDEV-3790 | Web UI: Bar chart for Loads by Vehicle chart                                            | To make the Loads by Vehicle chart more useful for analysis, the pie chart has been replaced with a bar chart. This allows the chart to be scrollable, increasing usability for larger vehicle fleets. See [Page not accessible](../../../../../../../../Page%20not%20accessible/Page%20not%20accessible.md).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| IBALDEV-3403 | Web UI: Notify user about no subscription                                               | Added the notification that a user doesn't have a subscription to have access to all Geo2 functionalities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| IBALDEV-3775 | Web UI: Update date and time input                                                      | Simplified the input for the date and time on such pages as Consignment and Load creation, and Consignment and Load search.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| IBALDEV-3524 | Web UI: Remove frames on Consignment card                                               | Removed frames on the Consignments card on such fields as Address, Consignment, and Planning instructions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| IBALDEV-3789 | API: Do not support IDs for consignment and load entities                               | Simplified the process of consignment and load creation within the API. It will no longer be possible to create a consignment or load using IDs for depot, vehicle, area, or channel. It is important to use the Key column from the Geo2 Environment Settings. This will now be written in the request to the API as: depotKey, vehicleKey, areaKey and channelKey.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
