## Set Up Organization

Once your account is created and the email is verified, you need to set up your Geo2 organization.  We ask for information about your company to set up an organization for you.

By pressing the `Continue` button, you will be redirected to Set up first depot page. This depot can be optionally used during route planning. You can add more depots later in Settings → Environment → [Hub: Depots Settings](Web-Based%20Hub/Hub_%20Environment%20Settings/Hub_%20Depots%20Settings.md).

You can start searching for the address by typing it in the Address line 1 field or giving access to your current geolocation.  Once the address is provided, you can drag and drop the pin on the map to adjust the address. By pressing the `Continue` button, your organization, environment, and its first depot will be created.

**Organization** is a group of users who share a subscription and collaborate on data in one or more environments. By default, for your newly created organization, **you get a** **Free subscription, no card required.**

Examples:

- A large company (organization) with smaller teams (environments) working on different projects.
- A holding company (organization) with smaller companies (environments) working in different spheres.
- A middle-size company (organization) with several depots (environments).
