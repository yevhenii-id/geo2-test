# Introduction

After signing in successfully, you will see the Map page. You may receive invitations to join other organizations. To [Hub: Accept Invitation](../Web-Based%20Hub/Hub_%20Accept%20Invitation.md), [Mobile App: Sign In](Mobile%20App_%20Sign%20In.md) to the app using the email address that received the invitation. If you have no invitations, the default organization will be created. The **Free level subscription** will be assigned, with **no card required**. You can start working with the app immediately:

- Plan routes
- Add stops using address search, scanning, and voice search
- Load vehicle with photos
- Start and complete routes
- Navigate to stops using your preferred navigation app (Waze, Google Maps, Apple Maps, etc.)
- Create PODs and vehicle checks with signatures and photos

# Plan Route

On Map page, by clicking the `Plan route` button, you can choose to create a route if you have permission to do it.  Check more details about [Mobile App: Routes and Orders](Mobile%20App_%20Routes%20and%20Orders.md).

# Assigned Routes

Routes assigned to you display automatically based on priority when you launch the app or complete a route. First, if you previously selected a route that is incomplete, the app reopens it. If not, and you have routes released for today, the app opens the earliest route unless you explicitly selected another route earlier today. You can start it, create vehicle check, navigate to stops, create PODs, and complete a route.

If neither applies, you will see an empty map with a relevant call to action.

After completing a route, if other routes remain today, a “Good job” bottom sheet appears with a **Go to next route** button that opens the next earliest incomplete route. If all today's routes are complete, the next step depends on your permissions: if you can create routes, you see a **Plan route** button; otherwise, you are directed to the **Routes** screen. When no routes exist for today, the empty state adjusts accordingly: if you can create routes, you are prompted to plan one. If you cannot create routes, you are directed to the **Routes** screen to view your future routes.

# Routes Calendar

Press the `route` icon to open Routes Calendar page. It lets you view routes that have been released to you.  By default, routes planned for the current date are shown, but you can select other dates to show routes for those dates.  The green dot below the date means that you have planned routes assigned to you for this date.  Learn more about [Mobile App: Routes and Orders](Mobile%20App_%20Routes%20and%20Orders.md).
