# Mobile app: Pending Uploads

If you have a bad internet connection while uploading pictures to the app for a POD or vehicle check and it takes more time to upload them, you can find them on Pending Uploads page in the Profile menu.  Once an internet connection is good again, they will be uploaded automatically. Alternatively, you can click on them to push photos one more time.
