If you are not invited to any organization, the default organization will be created once your account is registered. **Free level subscription** will be assigned to you, **no card required**. You will be redirected to Home page to start planning your routes.

If you want to edit your organization and environment settings, press `Settings` in the bottom menu. **Organization** is a group of users who share a subscription and collaborate on data in one or more environments. **Environments** let you represent teams within a single company or provide separate spaces for testing and productive use.

Examples:

- A large company (organization) with smaller teams (environments) working on different projects.
- A holding company (organization) with smaller companies (environments) working in different spheres.
- A middle-size company (organization) with several depots (environments).

As a Free level user, you will have only 1 environment. If you want to use more environments for different purposes, **upgrade to Enterprise**.
